        <td style="vertical-align: text-top;"><p>The <b>House of Salzberg</b> is one of, if not the most influential dynasty in the history of the Omniverse, as well as one of the two agnatic-cognatic lines of the proposed House of Salzberg-Wowza. Their members were various heads, lords, feuds, counts, emperors, kings, princes and dukes of themselves as well as the lands and <i>Royal Leagues</i> they ruled over, most notably the Empire of the ObsidiClaws, Kingdom of the SapphireClaws, Tribe of the AmberClaws, the Argentshroom, and a <i>de facto</i> royal league known as the <i>Soviet Union 2</i>. The dynasty was native to what would become the lands of the ObsidiClaws, and the first mention of Gyaidonus, who was directly related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_King">Four Dragon Kings</a> the semi-mythical founder of the Lordship/Subtribe of the ObsidiClaws, is very marginally documented as around sixty-six megaannums ago. The modern House of Salzberg also uniquely passes their surname down matrilineally.<br><br >The original founder of the House of the ObsidiClaws/Salzberg was Gyaidonus of the ObsidiClaws, while the builder of the Second ObsidiClaw Castle in the Hollow Earth Dimension was Evelyn Hamilton, Queen of Noricum, but the lord of the Salzbergids, Mr. Salzberg, founded the modern House of Salzberg by building the Salzberg Castle after the Second ObsidiClaw Castle was destroyed shortly after its creation.<br><br>Byaidonus, son of Gyaidonus, is the most famous Emperor of the ObsidiClaws for discovering reincarnation—a power now held by the current Empress (Chinese: <i>皇后</i>, Pinyin (Without diacritics): <i>Huanghou</i>), Darren/Darla Li. Byaidonus is celebrated for freeing the ObsidiClaws from the oppressive rule of the [Divine/Holy/Sacred] Kingdom of the TimberClaws, breaking ties and leading a successful rebellion that turned their duchy into an empire. Byaidonus pursued colonial expansion via the MagnaClaw Wormhole Network and ignited the Great MagnaClaw War with his aggressive imperialist ambitions. His campaign to conquer all MagnaClaw tribes was halted by Blue Trennis, Crowned Prince of the TimberClaws, due to a prophecy Byaidonus sought to prevent by committing the Great Genocide. Though not his only atrocity, it was his most infamous. In a desperate attempt to escape fate, he uncovered the dark art of reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Not much is known about the Great In-Between Era in general, let alone a people who ruled a fallen empire. This is due to the fact that Titan Earth had been completely destroyed by the First <i>Core</i> during the Great MagnaClaw War, and coincidentally at the time an Omniversal Crack happened, damaging the space-time continuum. The only important impact this had on the House of the ObsidiClaws and a few other dynasties/families was that they could now have younger people adopt older people, and other things that would essentially "twist" the family tree.<br><br>In 13,000 B.C., the ObsidiClaws—led by a reincarnated Byaidonus—landed on an alternate (or perhaps identical) Earth. They colonized half the planet, shaping early Homo Sapien culture, and established the "Sinican Empire," origin of the Latin prefix "Sino-." Their expansion was halted by the Franco-Finnic Empire (<i>Hyperborea</i>; per the Turan-Ural Altaic Hypothesis: <i>Proto-Finnic Holy Roman Khaganate</i>).</p>

  <p>The resulting conflict, known as the Sino-Hyperborean War (Turan-Ural: <a href="https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/Proto-Finnic_Holy_Roman_Khaganate"><i>Finno-Korean Hyperwar</i></a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mn--SOshZAXIxFKjSCEoSl0XfNz1-kMdRvHW9BIKCek/">unblocked version</a>), is the largest war in Earth’s history. Historical accounts split into two theories: the Turan-Ural Altaic and the Ao Guang Hypothesis. The former misinterpreted the Franco-Finnic Empire as purely Finnish and confused the Sinican Empire with Korea, largely due to poor cartography and a misleading 14,000 B.C. war declaration ("‘Finland’ against Altai").</p>

  <p>They also overlooked the Sino-Hispanic Condominium of Mars (not to be confused with the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Mars</a>), the Pori Insurgency, and the Imperium Hispania due to earlier regional biases, and also overlooked the Kingdom of Noricum, a constituent possession of the Sinican Empire due to a lack of its significance. Both hypotheses agree on the ending: the Sinican/Hwangeon Empire narrowly wins by activating the Mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">[REDACTED]</a> Array of Giza. The Ao Guang Hypothesis also uniquely claims the ObsidiClaws brought blueprints from the <i>Core</i> to Egypt to construct the device.</p>

  <p>Around tens of thousands of years later, Evelyn Hamilton, directly descended from the Noricum line of the House of the ObsidiClaws, builds a second castle for the ObsidiClaw family. She and her adopted daughter, Daphne Sobotnik, were the leaders of the House of the ObsidiClaws for a short period of time, before the castle was destroyed by a raid conducted by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/venomtheruler/">Venom the King Symbiote</a> (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/VenomTheKingSymbiote/">Old account (Defunct</a>)) Lord Robert Salzberg, leader of the Salzbergid branch of the House of the ObsidiClaws, built a third castle: The Salzberg Castle, and renamed the old House of the ObsidiClaws to the modern House of Salzberg, and the Salzbergids solidified into one with the rest of the family after the Siblinghood Pact between Huanghou Darren/Darla Li and Lord Violet/Val Cakmak.</p>

  <h2>Branches</h2>
  <hr width="100%" size="2">
  <p> As said previously, after an Omniversal Crack during the Great In-Between Era, certain families, including the House of Salzberg/the ObsidiClaws, were able to "twist" their families by making connections previously thought to be impossible. In the modern history of the House of Salzberg, this exploit has been used to a great extent, eventually making the family tree so incoherent that branches of the family tree are integral to the family itself in order to provide coherance. These branches include:</p>
  <h3>Li/ObsidiClaw Branch</h3>
  <p>Head: Huanghou Darren/Darla Li<br>Next-in-line: Crowned Princess Luna of the ObsidiClaws<br>The Li/ObsidiClaw branch is the main branch of the House of Salzberg as well as the oldest, as it is the original branch founded by Gyaidonus.<br> The Li/ObsidiClaw Branch is the most respected yet also most hated branch of the House of Salzberg, as they are the most influential branch at the cost of starting many different wars and even genocides.</p>
  <h3>Colthar Branch</h3>
  <p>Head: Asela "Vol" Colthar<br>The Colthar Branch was created after Asela, Empress of all foxes, attempted to adopt as many people as she could to expand the presence of the family, which eventually went out of hand and a new branch of the House of Salzberg.<br>Despite being called the Colthar branch, Asela Colthar is the only one in it that doesn't have the last name "Salzberg."</p>
  <h3>Ao Branch</h3>
  <p>Head: Hailongwang Ao Guang<br>Next-in-line: Wangchu Ao Bing (Chosen by Ao Guang despite being his third son)<br>The Ao branch is the second oldest branch of the House of Salzberg and is the only branch that is hereditarily hydrokinetic.</p>
  <h3>Cero Siete/Argentshroom branch</h3>
  <p>Head: Yersinia Cero Siete<br>The Cero Siete/Argentshroom branch is the branch of the House of Salzberg that rules the Argentshroom. It is one of the two branches that either currently or formerly have or had a marriage pact with the House of Wowza, the other being the Li/ObsidiClaw branch. (Although the marriage pact between the ObsidiClaw branch and the House of Wowza only applies to the Kingdom of the Driplets, making the pact between the Cero Siete/Argentshroom branch and the House of Wowza the only fully official one of the two.)</p>
